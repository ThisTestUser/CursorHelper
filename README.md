# CursorHelper

A tool to help you move your mouse accurately. It contains a mouse coordinate tracker, mouse mover, and window selector to determine the exact dimensions of an open window.

Note that the `mouseMove()` method in Robot is inaccurate for some devices. This program fixes this by momentarily moving the cursor to (0, 0) first, which may cause issues in certain scenarios.
